# How to run application:

- Clone repo
- Build and run FlightApi.sln with Visual Studio
- Example of local end point: http://localhost:49962/api/flights/find_route?origin=YYZ&destination=BNE

# Future Considerations
- Host API to public
- Aync methods 
- Caching
- More unit test to have full coverage
- Integration tests
- Add comments/documentation 
- https endpoint
- Authentication on endpoint
- Logging
- Handle big data sets
- Extend solution to consider a cost/weight for flights in route
