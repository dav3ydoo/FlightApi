# How to run application:

- Build and run FlightApi.sln with Visual Studio
- Local end point: http://localhost:49962/api/flights/find_route?origin=[origin]&destination=[destination]

# Future Considerations
- Host API to public
- Caching
- More unit tests 
- Integration tests
- Add comments/documentation 
- HTTPS
- Authentication
- Logging
- Handle large data set?
- Extend solution to consider a cost/weight for flights in route
